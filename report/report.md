## Abstract

This paper reports on a critical evaluation of two machine learning models in the task of identifying phishing websites. The models considered are ... some neural network ... and random forest. ... Summary of methodology used ... ... Summary of evaluation techniques ... ... Which model performed better? ... 

## I. Introduction

Phishing websites represent a subset of the wider phishing problem. ... motivation ...

The purpose of this paper ... 

The paper is organised as follows ... 

## II. Dataset

The dataset used in this study was taken from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, originally collected from the Phishtank data archive [3]. The dataset contains features corresponding to 1353 websites, classed as either legitimate, suspicious, or phishy, encoded as 1, 0, and -1 respectively. There is a slight imbalance between these classes occurring with a frequency of 548, 702 and 103 for legitamate, phishy and suspicious samples respectively. However, this imbalance is not dramatic enough to require additional sampling methods.

??? Require considering phishy and suspicious together

The values for each feature are scaled to -1, 0, and 1 so no further feature engineering was required.
